##The Story behind GearShare
######A group of outdoor enthusiasts who live in the city of Denver wish to pool their gear to save space in their homes and have more choices of activities on the weekends.
######They want to keep track of what they have stashed in different parts of the city, and allow everyone to use larger items owned by one person, such as a canoe. 

######This app was created using the MVC format with Node.js, MongoDB, EJS, and styled with Bootstrap.
